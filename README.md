# **React Native Course Project: Nucampsite**

In my React Native Course, we created an application for either Apple or Android Users to view a rental campsite website. 

1. You can view this project by first running the Json Server in a separate terminal.
Make sure your terminal is in the json folder first, then type in: json-server -H 0.0.0.0 --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000

2. Next,run npm start or npx, but make sure you have Expo Go installed in your VS Code first.
Scan the QR Code and It should work.

See Below for a screen shot of how it looks on a iPhone.
